# Privacy Metrics for Synthetic Data

This repository implements a set of privacy metrics proposed in the literature for measuring disclosure risks in synthetic data.

We identify two main groups of metrics: Distance and Similarity metrics and Attack-Based Metrics.

### Distance and Similarity Metrics

The metrics covered are the following: 

* Exact Matches
* Distance to Closest Record (DCR) 
* Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio (NNDR)
* Outliers Similarity 
* Cosine Similarity 
* Hausdorff Distance

### Attack-Based Metrics

Metrics supported for attribute disclosure as ML Task:
* Accuracy and F1 Score for Classification Tasks 
* MAE, R squared and MAPE for Regression Tasks
